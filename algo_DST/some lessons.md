# some lessons:

## There is always someone who is way smarter than you
    There is always a better solution

## The solution is already out there, DO NOT reinvent the wheel
    sure for the sake of practicing creativity, do it
    But don't reinvent the whell, don't spend too much time on it
        see others' solution.
        Nothing is new under the sun.

## off load thinking onto an external system, so you don't have to keep everything in your head
    your head is working playing with data and ideas
    not for keep tracking of datas

## play with some strategies first before diving deep into the details

## really think about the problem, get to know about it, and then relax and your brain come up with a solution
