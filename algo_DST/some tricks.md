# when need to do breadth first searching on matrix:
    how to get 4 or 8 directions easier?

# when comes to re-assign many pointers on a lnked list
    how to make it easier to manage all these pointers?

# when comes to going through a linked list:
    sometimes it is easier to have a dummy head = { next: ActualInputHead }
    this might be easier to start the iteration

# moving two pointers or multiple pointers
    especiall for sequential data structures like link list, array, string

    place one pointer at each end and move them toward each other
    place both at one end and move toward the other end
    move from back to front
    let one go earlier first and then move
    slide window, both move in one direction but at different time
