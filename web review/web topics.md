# HTML, CSS, REACT, DOM, General web, JS/TypeScript (Mabye should )

I am preparing for technical interviews as a software engineer for building web applications. What skills, topics I should know in terms of HTML, CSS and React.js, be as comprehensive as you need. Also make the content copy-able and in markdown format.


for all:
teach me on each topic
and then provide a few challenges to help me to memorize it

For html:
for any of the tags, teach me the tags and their attrs, and provide online resources
and then provide some tests for each tags to help memorize, if tests are not available, can try to ask me to explain things instead

function and sementic meaning of each tag
each attr of each tag

give me coding test on each tag
HTML interview questions and tests

new plan:
just go through all the links on w3school one by one
    then ask gpt to test me, and add the test to a list
    for all the stuffs that I don't remember, add it to the review list
        yeah just tell gpt to add al the thing I got wrong to a list
    at the end, tell it to output a list of all the tests
    and then a list of all the test I got wrong

some review:
there are some attrs that are available to all/most tags, class/id title
need to learn more about HTML tags
need to learn more about CSS
do I really need to know all of these?
    how about just tags
    and then some topics that I have encounter during work
    then the rest can be review/learned later on


some review:
    if keep on just keep on reading and not doing, I am not gonna remember
        how about aim at challenges? like building something in html?
        topic by topic
    a list of popular tags
        build something as challenge


should test by doing
html:
    <table>
    </table>
css:
    flex-direction: row
    justify-content: space-around

do very specific challenge
just like doing algorithm challenge
one/few topics per day
