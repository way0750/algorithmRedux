steps to do system design interview
1 start by clarifying requirements and think out loud be explict about how you think/understand the problem

what features, aspects, use case, what does it do?
what is the purpose?
what is the constrains:
    volume of requests
    how much traffic are using it
    what are the resources available?

2 working backwards/be use case focus/customer focus
    only do what is needed or appropriate for getting to the end goal


This is useful in life or in doing other things:
    know what exactly the goal is, and only focus on gather relavant resources, skills, and whatnot to just achive the goal. Don't be a perfectionist

Defining scaling requirements:
    scale of traffic
    scale of data
    the speed/latancy
    availablity/data consistancy
    what exactly are the numbers of latency/customers count/data, etc...?
    you might need to make estimation

if they don't tell you much, then see it from the end user's perspective

But in any case, make sure the interview is ok with all the requirements/constrains

Trick:
    get use to some online platform so you are comfortable enough to
    quickly draw out the system

Sketching out the design:
    always start with abstract, high level design first, then go
    into details

    Ask if you can make certain assumption, use off shielf solutions

    talk about if it meets the requirement and scalibility and constrains
    talk about the potential problems: sudden power outage, service,
    talk about why you choose certain technology
    talk about why you design things in certain way

    components out of service, potential scalability problem
    provide time for interviewer to ask questions

Might need to talk about the data schema.
    time to learn SQL
Might need to talk about APIs
    instead of providing a visual interface to interact with the system
    you will be interacting by APIs


Work with the interviwer:
    Think of it as working in real life, they will 100% judge you base on your behavior and if they would like to work with you at all.
