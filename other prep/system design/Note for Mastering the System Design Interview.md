# how to learn:
    watch the video or read the book/article
    then use AI to come up with lessons/questions to test you
        repeat if need to
    Don't just keep on moving on from one topic to next
        make sure that you have an understanding of it
            don't be perfect, just need to know at the high level so later you can refer to it
            When you are doing challenges, you will know what matters, what don't
                just in-time just needed learning
    
# scalling
    scalling servers
    scalling data layer
        what are the concerns and strategies to implement?

# data base features/capabilities:
    replication: what is it how's it done? pros/cons

# horizontal scaling of databases: sharding
    what is sharding?

# when designing a data system:
    try to think of the use case and how to turn it into simple key-value store as schema

# data base, data lake, data warehouse
    data lake: nothing just a bucket of all sorts of unstructured data
        a big file store

# data partitioning vs sharding
    what's the difference
