# so how to go about this:
for each data structure
    find the challenges that could be solved using that structure
    find out what are the common techniques working with that data structure

for each algorithm
    just practice each topic that should be good enough
    or if the topics is too big, then break it into smaller ones

overall:
    each day, redo the challenges that you had difficulty with
        this is how you set those patterns in your head
    spend only 10 minutes max on trying to find out how to solve it
    if can't then spend another 10 minutes using AI/youtube for help
    if still can't, move on
    use typescript or python to code
    ask AI to:
        generate testing cases for me for certain problem


some review:
    sometimes I just can't get a hang of it even if I watch a video/illustration
    skip them
    for those you struggle, but eventually understood, save them
